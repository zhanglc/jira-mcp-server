- ✅ Configurable similarity thresholds and suggestion limits

### 3. Tool Handler Enhancement
- ✅ Updated `ToolHandler` to use enhanced validation capabilities
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with intelligent suggestions
- ✅ Improved field validation warnings with confidence metadata
- ✅ Maintained full backward compatibility

### 4. Configuration Integration
- ✅ Added smart suggestions configuration options:
  - `enableSmartSuggestions` (default: true)
  - `suggestionSimilarityThreshold` (default: 0.4)
  - `maxSuggestionsPerField` (default: 5)
- ✅ Environment variable support for all new options
- ✅ Zod schema validation for configuration

### 5. Field Usage Analysis Integration
- ✅ Integrated `FieldUsageAnalyzer` (Task-12) into enhanced validation
- ✅ Usage statistics enhance validation confidence scores
- ✅ Real-world field availability rates inform suggestions
- ✅ Configurable analysis sample sizes and thresholds

## Key Features Implemented

### Enhanced Validation Capabilities
```typescript
// New method in HybridResourceHandler
async validateFieldPathsWithSuggestions(
  entityType: string,
  paths: string[]
): Promise<EnhancedBatchValidationResult>

// Enhanced result includes:
interface EnhancedBatchValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  validPaths: string[];
  invalidPaths: string[];
  pathInfo?: Record<string, {
    fieldId: string;
    type: string;
    description: string;
    confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    availabilityRate?: number;
    sources: string[];
  }>;
  suggestions?: Record<string, string[]>;
}
```

### Smart Suggestions
```typescript
// Real-time field suggestions
async suggestFieldPaths(
  entityType: string,
  partialPath: string,
  maxSuggestions: number = 5
): Promise<string[]>

// Enhanced field information
async getEnhancedFieldInfo(
  entityType: string,
  fieldPath: string
): Promise<FieldInfo | null>
```

### Enhanced Error Messages
- Field validation errors now include intelligent suggestions
- Confidence scores and availability rates in metadata
- Multi-source validation with fallback strategies
- Improved user experience with actionable error messages

- ✅ Graceful fallback when enhanced features unavailable
- ✅ Optional feature activation through configuration
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing tool handlers

### Migration Path
- Enhanced features are opt-in via configuration
- Existing code automatically benefits from improved validation
- Progressive enhancement approach for adoption

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Smart Suggestions Configuration
ENABLE_SMART_SUGGESTIONS=true
SUGGESTION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.4
MAX_SUGGESTIONS_PER_FIELD=5

# Field Analysis Configuration (for enhanced suggestions)
DYNAMIC_FIELD_ANALYSIS=true
FIELD_ANALYSIS_SAMPLE_SIZE=10
```

### Programmatic Configuration
```typescript
const config: HybridConfig = {
  // ... existing config
  enableSmartSuggestions: true,
  suggestionSimilarityThreshold: 0.4,
  maxSuggestionsPerField: 5,
  dynamicFieldAnalysis: true,
  fieldAnalysisSampleSize: 10
};
```
